        <h3 class="title">Description</h3>
        <p>There's a restaurant down the street called McDonald's but we're McDowell's. They've got the golden arches, ours is the golden arcs. They've got the Big Mac, we've got the Big Mic. 
            Then they came out with the McRib, so this is the McRub. It tastes a lot like a McRib, but that's just a coincidence. But the McRub is the real authentic original McRib!
         </p>
         <h3 class="title">Ingredients List</h3>
         <h2 class="small title">For the Dry Rub</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp chili powder</li>
            <li>2 tbsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tbsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tsp cayenne pepper (unless you need an extra kick, then make it 2 tsp!)</li>
         </ul>
         <h2 class="small title">For the Sandwiches</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>2 racks babyback pork ribs</li>
            <li>1 cup barbecue sauce (regional differences allowed)</li>
            <li>4 sesame hamburger rolls, split and toasted</li>
            <li>1 cup coleslaw</li>
         </ul>
         <h3 class="title">Steps</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degress F (165 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Mix salt, brown sugar, chili powder, pepper, cumin, and cayenne togerther for the rub</li>
            <li>Place ribs on a foil-lined baking sheet and season both sides generously with that delicious rub. Reserve the remaining rub for another use. Cover the top with parchment paper and wrap foil over the edges. Cover the whole baking sheet with another large sheet of foil, sealing in the sides.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 2 hours and 45 minutes. Enough time for a long movie!</li>
            <li>Unwrap the ribs and let them cool briefly until they're safe to handle. Pull out the bones, stuffing any loose pieces of meat back into the holes and checking carefully for bone fragments. Wrap the ribs back up (ha, you thought you were going to eat them now, didn't you!) and refrigerate until cold, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>In the morning when the ribs are cool, cut each rack in half. Brush both sides generously with barbecue sauce.</li>
            <li>Preheat a charcoal grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Grill the ribs until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove from the grill and add more, yup, barbecue sauce!</li>
            <li>Drizzle more barbecue sauce onto each roll (you can never add too much!). Sandwich each rib section between a roll and top with coleslaw.</li>
            <li>You're finally done! Time to eat that delicious sandwich. And when your friends ask, remember, it's the McRub!</li>
         </ol>
