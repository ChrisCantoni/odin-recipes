        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>My family and I have always longed for the old country. Italians love their
            pasta and this Italian is no different. This lasagna recipe harkens back to a simpler
            time when my great great grandmother kneeded the dough herself before flattening it out and
            filling it with the most delicious sausage and cheeses you can imagine. Lasagna! When you're here 
            you're family!
         </p>
         <h3>Ingredients List</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
            <li>3/4 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 6.5-ounce cans of tomato sauce (or make your own like mom)</li>
            <li>2 6-ounce cans of tomato paste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tbsp white sugar</li>
            <li>4 tbsp chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1.5 tsp dried basil</li>
            <li>1.5 tsp salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp fennel seeds</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp ground black pepper</li>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles (fresh made like grandma's!)</li>
            <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>3/4 cup Parmesan cheese, grated</li>

         </ul>

         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Gather your ingredients</li>
            <li>Cook the sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until cooked through.</li>
            <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tbsp parsley, basil, 1 tsp of salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered for about 1.5 hours, stirring occasionally. Put on your favorite romantic comedy, those usually last about 90 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles in the water for 8 to 10 minues. Drain them and rinse with <strong>cold</strong> water. It helps keep the noodles from sticking.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with the single egg, the remaining 2 tbsp of parsley and 1/2 tsp of salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C if you're from the old country).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1/5 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over the meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese. Spoon 1/5 cups of meat sauce over the mozzarella and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>See step 7. You're building a house and each floor has the same ingredients. Top the top with any remaining cheese and cover with foil. If you'd like to prevent sticking, spray the foil with cooking spray or keep it away from that cheese!</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then remove the foil and bake an additional 25 minutes. That adds up to 50 minutes, the perfect amount of time to finish that romcom you started!</li>
            <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest 15 minutes before dishing it out to your grateful family!</li>
